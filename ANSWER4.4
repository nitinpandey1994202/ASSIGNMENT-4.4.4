QUESTION:-
1. Write a Java program to copy a file from HDFS to LFS
2. Explain the importance and usage of the below terms in details
            ● DFSInputStream 
            ● DFSOutputStream
            ● FSDataInputStream
            ● FSDataOutputStream
            
 ANSWER:-
 1)-
    IMAGE HAS BEEN ATTACHED.
    
 2)- DFSInputStream :  Called internally by FSDataInputStream.Handles communication of the namenodewith various datanodes. 
 Handles integrity of data contained by the blocks.Manages data read activity in case of datanodefailure.

FSDataInputStream :Provides stream (channel) for reading data.
                   FSDataInputStream
                   Lets the application read from a file
                   FSDataInputStream in = fs.open(new Path(uri));

FSDataOutputStream :Provides stream (channel) for writing data.
                    OutputStreamout = fs.create(new Path(dst));
                    IOUtils.copyBytes(in, out, 4096, true);


DFSOutputStream :Handles communication of the namenodewith various datanodes.
                 Called internally by FSDataOutputStream
